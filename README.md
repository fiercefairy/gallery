# Event Countdown

If you want to setup an event clock for your gallery, edit `./src/data/galleries.json` add add an `eventTime` as a unix timestamp (https://www.unixtimestamp.com) for the moment in time that the event will begin and `eventURL` that will display as a link to the event location when the countdown finishes.

Example:

```
"prosopagnosia": {
    "eventTime": 1618167600000,
    "eventURL": "https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1c2e1WMKKtf6oBZcZK3YFxrXgVbb2ggRr9",
    "description": "\"I can't remember her face, but when she looked at me, it felt like this.\"",
    "main": 25769,
    "items": [25769, 25896, 25900, 25918, 25948, 25998, 26001, 26002]
  }
```
